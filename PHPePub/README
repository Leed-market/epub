TODO:
* A LOT, there is a new version (tentatively version 2.15) being written remodelling a lot of the class structure. The goal being to encompas the majority of the features in teh ePub 2.0 specification, except the Daisy type files.
* Add support for Multiple NavPoint levels, ie. allowing for multiple books or articlesin in a single ePub file.
* Add better handling of Reference structures.
* Add full coverage of all Dublin Core meta tags supported by the ePub 2.01 specification.
* Add full coverage of all Marc Codes recommended by the ePub 2.01 specification.
* Improve handling of media types and linked files.
* A/V content is allowed, but definitely not recommended, and MUST have a fallback chain ending in a valid file. If no such chain is provided, the content should not be added.
* Documentation, no one reads it, but everyone complains if it is missing.
* Better examples to fully cover the capabilities of the EPub classes.
* more TODO's.
* ePub 3.0.
